# Practice Sessions

Practice sessions are the core of Practice!. Each session is a focused block of time where you work on your tunes. The app tracks what you practice, how long you practice, and how well you're doing - all to help you improve more effectively.

**Why use practice sessions?** When you start a session, the app begins tracking your time and suggests tunes that need practice. This helps you focus on what matters most instead of wondering what to practice next. At the end of each session, you can see how much you accomplished, which builds motivation and helps you track your progress over time.

## Starting a Practice Session

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Navigate to Practice tab</strong>
    <p>Tap the play button icon in the bottom navigation bar.</p>
</div>


<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Tap "Start Practice Session"</strong>
    <p>This begins a new practice session and starts the session timer.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Select an instrument (optional)</strong>
    <p>If instrument tracking is enabled in Settings, you'll be prompted to select which instrument you're practicing with.</p>
</div>

## Selecting Tunes to Practice

**Why the app suggests tunes:** The app shows you tunes that are due for review based on your spaced repetition schedule. These are tunes you've practiced before, and the app has calculated that now is a good time to practice them again - right before you'd start to forget them. This makes your practice time more effective.

**When to search instead:** Sometimes you want to practice a specific tune, maybe one you're preparing for a performance or one you just learned. You can always search for any tune in your library, even if it's not due for review yet.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Choose from suggested tunes</strong>
    <p>The app displays tunes that are due for review based on your spaced repetition schedule. These are the tunes that will benefit most from practice right now.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Search for a specific tune</strong>
    <p>Use the search bar to find a tune by title, composer, or tags if you want to practice something specific.</p>
</div>


<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Select a tune</strong>
    <p>Tap on a tune to begin practicing it. The tune detail view will open.</p>
</div>

### Tune Picker reference

The tune picker includes several icons to help you find the right tune quickly:

## Practice Tools

### Session Timer

**Why track your time:** Seeing how long you've practiced helps you build a consistent habit. Maybe you want to practice 30 minutes a day, or maybe you're trying to increase your practice time gradually. The timer runs automatically, so you don't have to think about it - just focus on practicing.

The session timer automatically tracks how long you've been practicing. It starts when you begin a session and continues until you end the session.

![Session timer display during active practice]({{ '/assets/images/practice-session-active-timer.png' | relative_url }})

### Metronome

**Why use a metronome:** Playing at a steady tempo is one of the most important skills for any musician. A metronome helps you develop this skill by giving you a steady beat to follow. Start slow and gradually increase the tempo as you get more comfortable with a tune.

The metronome provides a steady beat to help you practice at a consistent tempo. Use it when you're learning a new tune to keep yourself from rushing, or when you're polishing a tune to make sure you can play it at the right speed.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Access the metronome</strong>
    <p>During a practice session, tap the metronome button.</p>
</div>


<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Start the metronome</strong>
    <p>Tap the play button to start the metronome at the current BPM setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Adjust tempo</strong>
    <p>Tap the settings icon to open metronome settings where you can adjust BPM, time signature, and sound options.</p>
</div>

![Metronome settings screen]({{ '/assets/images/metronome-settings.png' | relative_url }})

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">4</span>
    <strong>Stop the metronome</strong>
    <p>Tap the pause button to stop the metronome.</p>
</div>

### Rest Timer

**Why take breaks:** Taking regular breaks prevents fatigue and helps you practice more effectively. Your hands and mind need rest, especially during longer practice sessions. The rest timer reminds you to step away for a few minutes, so you come back refreshed and ready to focus.

The rest timer helps you take breaks between practice sessions or tunes. Set it for 2-5 minutes when you feel yourself getting tired, or use it to structure your practice into focused blocks with breaks in between.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Open rest timer</strong>
    <p>During a practice session, tap the rest timer button.</p>
</div>



<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Set duration</strong>
    <p>Choose a preset duration or set a custom time. The default is 2 minutes.</p>
</div>



<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Start the timer</strong>
    <p>Tap "Start" to begin the countdown. You'll receive a notification when the timer completes, even if the app is in the background.</p>
</div>


### Session Notes

**Why take notes:** Notes help you remember what you worked on and what to focus on next time. Maybe you discovered a tricky passage that needs more work, or you figured out a fingering that works well. Notes make it easy to pick up where you left off.

You can add notes during or after a practice session. Session notes are general notes about the whole practice session (like "worked on Irish tunes today" or "focused on tempo"). Tune-specific notes appear when you practice that tune again, so you can remember what you were working on last time.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Add session notes</strong>
    <p>During a session, tap the notes field to add general notes about your practice - what you focused on, how it went, or what you want to work on next time.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Add tune-specific notes</strong>
    <p>When rating a tune, you can add notes specific to that tune. These notes will appear the next time you practice that tune, so you can remember what you were working on - like "work on the B section" or "fingering for measure 8 needs practice."</p>
</div>

## Rating Your Practice

**Why ratings matter:** After practicing a tune, you rate how it went. This rating tells the app when you should practice that tune again. Be honest with your ratings - if you struggled, rate it as "Difficult" so the app will bring it back soon. If you played it confidently, rate it as "Easy" so the app will schedule it further out. The more accurate your ratings, the better the app can help you learn.

After practicing a tune, you'll be asked to rate your performance. This is how the app learns which tunes need more practice and which ones you've mastered.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Finish practicing a tune</strong>
    <p>When you're done with a tune, you'll see the practice rating screen.</p>
</div>

![Practice rating screen with tune title and rating options]({{ '/assets/images/practice-rating-screen.png' | relative_url }})

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Select a rating</strong>
    <p>Choose one of three options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Difficult</strong> - You struggled with this tune or made mistakes</li>
        <li><strong>Good</strong> - You played it reasonably well with minor issues</li>
        <li><strong>Easy</strong> - You played it confidently and accurately</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Add notes (optional)</strong>
    <p>You can add notes about what you worked on, what was challenging, or what to focus on next time.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">4</span>
    <strong>Save the rating</strong>
    <p>Tap "Save" to record your rating. The tune will be scheduled for review based on your rating.</p>
</div>

<div class="info">
    <strong>How ratings affect scheduling:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Difficult</strong> → Tune moves to "Next Session" bucket (appears again soon)</li>
        <li><strong>Good</strong> → Tune moves up one bucket (longer interval)</li>
        <li><strong>Easy</strong> → Tune moves up one bucket (even longer interval)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
