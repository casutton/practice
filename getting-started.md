# Getting Started

Practice! helps you learn new music and track your practicing. I wrote it to help me learn folk tunes, but it can be used for any kind of music you want to learn.
I wanted to be able to help me keep track of what
music I know, memorize more music, motivate myself to practice, and set goals for myself during practice.


## What You Can Do

Practice! helps you:

- **Practice tunes with smart scheduling** - The app tracks which tunes you know well and which need more practice, then suggests tunes at the right time for effective learning
- **Organize your tune library** - Keep track
of music that you know. Use genres, tags, and custom fields to keep your tunes organized. Search
intelligently, whether during practice or in a jam.
Keep links to sheet music, if that's your thing.
- **Track your practice time** - See how much you've practiced each day, week, or month
- **Set and achieve goals** - Create daily, weekly, or monthly goals to stay motivated
- **Use practice tools** - Metronome, rest timer, and session notes help you practice effectively
- **Track progress over time** - See your practice history and how your skills improve
- **Practice exercises** - Work on technical skills with dedicated exercise tracking
- **Create practice plans** - Group related tunes together for focused practice sessions

## Core Concepts

### Spaced Repetition

**Why it matters:** Research shows that spacing out your practice over time helps you remember things better than cramming. Instead of practicing the same tunes every day, the app helps you practice tunes right when you're about to forget them - which is when practice is most effective.

**How it works:** After you practice a tune, you rate how it went. The app uses that rating to decide when you should practice it again. Tunes you struggled with will come back soon, while tunes you know well won't appear as often. This means you spend more time on tunes that need work, and less time on tunes you've already mastered.

### Practice Sessions

**Why sessions matter:** A practice session is like a focused block of time where you work on your tunes. By tracking sessions, you can see your progress over time and build a consistent practice habit.

**What happens in a session:** You practice multiple tunes, use tools to help you practice better (like a metronome to keep steady tempo), and rate how each tune went. The app tracks how long you practiced, which helps you see your progress and stay motivated.

### Buckets

**Why buckets help:** Instead of trying to remember which tunes need practice, the app organizes them into "buckets" based on how well you know them. When you rate a tune as "Difficult," it goes into a bucket that makes it appear again soon. When you rate it as "Easy," it moves to a bucket that schedules it further out. This way, the app automatically keeps track of what needs your attention.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Start a session</strong>
    <p>Tap "Start Practice Session" to begin. Optionally select an instrument if you have instrument tracking enabled.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Select a tune</strong>
    <p>Choose a tune from the list, or use the search bar to find a specific tune. The app will suggest tunes that are due for review.</p>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">4</span>
    <strong>Practice the tune</strong>
    <p>Play through the tune. You can use the metronome, rest timer, and other tools during practice.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">5</span>
    <strong>Rate your performance</strong>
    <p>After practicing, rate how it went: <strong>Difficult</strong>, <strong>Good</strong>, or <strong>Easy</strong>. This determines when the tune will appear again.</p>
</div>
