# Exercises

Exercises are technical practice routines that help you improve specific skills. Unlike tunes, exercises focus on technique, scales, arpeggios, or other fundamental skills. 
You can track which exercises you practice, and we keep track of them in a separate place from tunes, so they don't clutter up your library of music.
