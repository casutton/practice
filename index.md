# Getting Started

FolkTunesApp helps you learn and practice folk tunes using spaced repetition. This guide will help you understand the core concepts and get started with your first practice session.

## Core Concepts

### Spaced Repetition

The app uses a spaced repetition system to schedule when you should practice each tune. Tunes you know well appear less frequently, while tunes you're learning appear more often.

### Practice Sessions

A practice session is a period of focused practice. During a session, you can:
- Practice multiple tunes
- Use tools like a metronome and rest timer
- Track your time
- Rate your performance on each tune

### Buckets

Tunes are organized into "buckets" based on how well you know them. When you rate a tune after practicing, it moves to a different bucket, which determines when it will appear again.
