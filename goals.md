# Practice Goals

There are four "motivational things" in Practice!:

1. Goals: These are messages to yourself about what you want to achieve next session, this week, this month. You set these in Improve > Goals. 
2. Targets: This a goal for how much you want to practice, like "Practice 30 minutes every day" or "5 hours a week". You set these in Improve > Targets.
3. Reminders: You can set reminders to practice in Improve > Reminders. These come up as notifications on your phone.
4. Badges: The app tracks your progress and rewards you with badges for milestones you reach, if that's your thing. You can see this in History > Badges.


## Goal Types

### Daily Goals

**When to use daily goals:** Daily goals are perfect for building a regular practice habit. Maybe you want to practice 20 minutes every day, or practice at least 3 tunes each day. Daily goals reset each morning, so you start fresh every day. This helps you build consistency - even if you miss a day, you can pick right back up the next day.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Create a daily goal</strong>
    <p>Go to Improve > Goals and tap the "+" button. Select "Daily" as the goal type.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Set your target</strong>
    <p>Choose what to track (Time, Tunes, Exercises, or Sessions) and set your target value.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Configure timing (optional)</strong>
    <p>You can restrict when the goal appears:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specific days of the week</li>
        <li>First session of the week only</li>
        <li>Specific instrument</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Weekly Goals

**When to use weekly goals:** Weekly goals are great when you want more flexibility in your schedule. Maybe you can't practice every day, but you want to practice 2 hours total each week. Weekly goals let you practice more on some days and less on others, as long as you hit your weekly target. This works well for people with busy or irregular schedules.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Create a weekly goal</strong>
    <p>Select "Weekly" as the goal type when creating a new goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Set start and end dates</strong>
    <p>The app will automatically set the week boundaries, or you can customize them.</p>
</div>

### Monthly Goals

Monthly goals help you track progress over a longer period.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Create a monthly goal</strong>
    <p>Select "Monthly" as the goal type.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Set the month</strong>
    <p>Choose which month the goal applies to, or let it default to the current month.</p>
</div>

### Streak Goals

**When to use streak goals:** Streak goals help you build a daily practice habit by tracking how many days in a row you've practiced. The longer your streak, the more motivated you'll be to keep it going. Streak goals are great for building consistency - even if you only practice for 10 minutes, it keeps your streak alive and helps you maintain the habit.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Create a streak goal</strong>
    <p>Select "Streak" as the goal type.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Set target days</strong>
    <p>Choose how many consecutive days you want to practice.</p>
</div>

<div class="screenshot placeholder">
    <div class="caption">Screenshot: Streak goal showing current streak and target</div>
</div>

## Goal Units

Goals can track different metrics:

- **Time** - Total practice time in minutes
- **Tunes** - Number of tunes practiced
- **Exercises** - Number of exercises completed
- **Sessions** - Number of practice sessions
