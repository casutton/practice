# Practice Goals

There are four "motivational things" in Practice!:

1. Goals: These are messages to yourself about what you want to achieve next session, this week, this month. You set these in Improve > Goals. 
2. Targets: This a goal for how much you want to practice, like "Practice 30 minutes every day" or "5 hours a week". You set these in Improve > Targets.
3. Reminders: You can set reminders to practice in Improve > Reminders. These come up as notifications on your phone.
4. Badges: The app tracks your progress and rewards you with badges for milestones you reach, if that's your thing. You can see this in History > Badges.


## 1. Goals

Goals are personal reminders to yourself about what you want to achieve. Unlike Targets (which track quantitative metrics), Goals are qualitative messages you set to guide your practice.

### Creating a Goal

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Navigate to Goals</strong>
    <p>Go to Improve > Goals and tap the "+" button.</p>
</div>

![New goal screen]({{ '/assets/images/add-goal-view.png' | relative_url }})

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Enter goal details</strong>
    <p>Fill in the goal form:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> - A short description of your goal (e.g., "Work on intonation")</li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong> - Optional additional notes about your goal</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Choose Time Frame</strong>
    <p>Select when you want to work on this goal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Next Session</strong> - The goal appears every practice session until completed</li>
        <li><strong>This Week</strong> - The goal is active for the current week</li>
        <li><strong>This Month</strong> - The goal is active for the current month</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">4</span>
    <strong>Set Filters (Optional)</strong>
    <p>Restrict when the goal should appear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Days of Week</strong> - Select specific days when this goal should appear</li>
        <li><strong>First Session of Week</strong> - Only show on your first practice session each week</li>
        <li><strong>Instrument</strong> - Only show when practicing a specific instrument (if multi-instrument mode is enabled)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Completing Goals

When you're finished with a goal, you can mark it complete:

1. Swipe left on the goal and tap "Complete", or
2. Tap on the goal and select "Mark as Complete"

You'll be prompted to add a completion note describing what you achieved. Goals support three completion statuses:
- **Needs Work** - You made progress but want to continue working on this
- **Good** - You achieved satisfactory results  
- **Great** - You exceeded your expectations

![Goal completion status]({{ '/assets/images/goal-completion-status.png' | relative_url }})

### Viewing Goals

![Active goals list]({{ '/assets/images/goals-list-active.png' | relative_url }})

The Goals view shows your **Active Goals** at the top and **Completed Goals** in a separate section below. Completed goals can be reactivated by swiping and tapping "Unarchive".

## 2. Targets

Targets are quantitative practice goals that track how much you want to practice. Unlike Goals (which are qualitative reminders), Targets measure specific metrics.

### Creating a Target

Navigate to **Improve > Targets** to set up your practice targets.

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Choose Target Type</strong>
    <p>Enable either a Daily Target, Weekly Target, or both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily Target</strong> - A goal you want to achieve each day</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly Target</strong> - A goal you want to achieve each week</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Choose What to Track</strong>
    <p>Select the unit you want to measure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time</strong> - Track practice time in minutes (e.g., "30 minutes per day")</li>
        <li><strong>Sessions</strong> - Track number of practice sessions (e.g., "1 session per day")</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Set Your Target Value</strong>
    <p>Enter how much you want to practice. For time-based targets, you can set hours and minutes.</p>
</div>

### Target Examples

- "Practice 30 minutes every day"
- "Complete 5 practice sessions per week"
- "Practice 2 hours per week"

## 3. Reminders

Reminders are push notifications that prompt you to practice. You can set these up in **Improve > Reminders**.

### Daily Practice Reminders

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">1</span>
    <strong>Enable Reminders</strong>
    <p>Toggle "Enable Practice Reminders" to turn on notifications.</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">2</span>
    <strong>Choose Days</strong>
    <p>Select which days of the week you want to receive reminders (e.g., weekdays only).</p>
</div>

<div class="flow-step">
    <span class="step-number">3</span>
    <strong>Set Reminder Time</strong>
    <p>Choose what time you want to be reminded to practice.</p>
</div>

### Streak Protection

There's a special "Remind me about current streak" option that sends you a reminder later in the day if you haven't practiced yet. This helps protect your practice streak by giving you a heads-up before the day ends.

<div class="info">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Set your streak protection reminder for the evening (e.g., 8:00 PM) so you get a nudge if you've forgotten to practice that day.
</div>
