# Practice Plans

Sometimes you want to focus on a specific set of tunes - maybe you're preparing for a performance, learning a set for a session, or working on tunes from a particular book. Practice plans let you group related tunes
and exercises together so you can practice them as a set. 

When you start a practice session, you can select a plan and see the tunes 
you have listed so you can work through them.
